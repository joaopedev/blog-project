                <h2>Lions</h2>
                <p>The lion (scientific name: Panthera leo) is a type of carnivorous mammal of the genus Panthera and of the family Felidae. The species is currently found in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, with a single remaining population in danger, in Gir Forest National Park, Gujarat, India. It was extinct in North Africa and Southwest Asia in historical times, and even the Upper Pleistocene, some 10,000 years ago, was the most widespread large land mammal after humans, found in most of Africa, in much of Eurasia, from Western Europe to India, and in America, from the Yukon to Mexico. It is one of the four big cats, with some males exceeding 250 kilograms in weight, being the second largest recent cat after the tiger.</p>

                <h2>Lioness</h2>
                <p>These big cats live in flocks of 5 to 40 individuals, being the only cats with gregarious habits. In a flock, there is a division of tasks: the females are in charge of hunting and caring for the young, while the male is responsible for the demarcation of the territory and for the defense of the group of larger or more numerous animals (against possible attacks by hyenas, buffaloes, elephants and other male lions).</p>
